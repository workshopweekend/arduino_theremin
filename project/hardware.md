+ [1 Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021). We use the Arduino Uno, but any standard Arduino is appropriate for this project.
+ [1 breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12002).
+ [HC-SR04 Ultrasound distance sensor](http://www.oddwires.com/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-sensor-distance-measuring-module/)
+ [Piezo buzzer](https://www.pololu.com/product/187). These are great low-speed motors, but there are many other options!
+ [Jumper Wires](https://www.pololu.com/product/199). These should fit snugly on the motors.
+ 5mm LEDs (red, yellow and green, total 8)
+ 220 ohm resistors
